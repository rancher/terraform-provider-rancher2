# Rancher2 Provider

The Rancher2 provider is used to interact with the
resources supported by Rancher v2. 

The provider can be configured in 2 modes:
- Admin: this is the default mode, intended to manage rancher2 resources. It should be configured with the `api_url` of the Rancher server and API credentials, `token_key` or `access_key` and `secret_key`.
- Bootstrap: this mode is intended to bootstrap a rancher2 system. It is enabled if `bootstrap = true`. In this mode, `token_key` or `access_key` and `secret_key` can not be provided. More info at [rancher2_bootstrap resource](resources/bootstrap.html)

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Configure the Rancher2 provider to admin
provider "rancher2" {
  api_url    = "https://rancher.my-domain.com"
  access_key = var.rancher2_access_key
  secret_key = var.rancher2_secret_key
}
```

```hcl
# Configure the Rancher2 provider to bootstrap
provider "rancher2" {
  api_url   = "https://rancher.my-domain.com"
  bootstrap = true
}
```

```hcl
# Configure the Rancher2 provider to bootstrap and admin
# Provider config for bootstrap
provider "rancher2" {
  alias = "bootstrap"

  api_url   = "https://rancher.my-domain.com"
  bootstrap = true
}

# Create a new rancher2_bootstrap using bootstrap provider config
resource "rancher2_bootstrap" "admin" {
  provider = "rancher2.bootstrap"

  password = "blahblah"
}

# Provider config for admin
provider "rancher2" {
  alias = "admin"

  api_url = rancher2_bootstrap.admin.url
  token_key = rancher2_bootstrap.admin.token
  insecure = true
}

# Create a new rancher2 resource using admin provider config
resource "rancher2_catalog" "foo" {
  provider = "rancher2.admin"

  name = "test"
  url = "http://foo.com:8080"
}
```
